This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}

library(readr)
ds_salaries <- read_csv("Downloads/ds_salaries.csv")
View(ds_salaries)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
attach(ds_salaries)

library(ggplot2)
```
```{r}
summary(ds_salaries)
```
```{r}
mutate(ds_salaries)
```


```{r}
for(i in 1:length(ds_salaries$experience_level)){
  if ((ds_salaries$experience_level[i] == "EN")){
    ds_salaries$experience_level[i]<-0
  }
  else if((ds_salaries$experience_level[i]=='MI')){
    ds_salaries$experience_level[i]<-1
  }
  else if ((ds_salaries$experience_level[i]=='SE')){
    ds_salaries$experience_level[i]<-2
  }
  else{
    ds_salaries$experience_level[i]<-3
  }
}
print(ds_salaries)
```
```{r}
ds_salaries<-subset(ds_salaries,employment_type=="FT")
print(ds_salaries)

```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
